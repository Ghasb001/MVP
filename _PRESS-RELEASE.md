There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  RPP2209 Cohort Sheet/Github Fetche

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  This products is primarily for the cohort to use for the current students, but can be adapted for any cohort that comes along.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  This app/webpage allows a user to click on a student's name on the list, and the webpage automatically send the user to the student's Github repository page. This will make pairing with another classmate easier, and checking in on work that they both have worked on during pairing sessions.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  This app streamlines the flow to find a student's github repo, rather than clicking through an excel sheet and having to search the username on Github. There are also times when we may accidentally enter a username, adn the information that appears is incorreet, due to a typing error.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Upon the user clicking on the student's name, the webpage redirects to the exact Github repository page. This page also prevents staff or students from accidentally clicking on an incorrect user on Github, since the student can confirm their page when they are onboarded. Any updates to the username can also be updated on the databse, so our information is kept up to date.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "This page makes it much easier to follow my partner's Github repos, adn see the prevous work we did together."
        -Guillermo Hasbun

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  To get started, just open up the page, and click on a student. It's that easy!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Wow, I was able to see the code that Guillermo and I worked on together while pairing with just a click. This is amazing!"
        - RPP2209 student(s) that paired with Guillermo

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  In conclusion, this page helps to make students' pairing sessions and classwork review easier and less frustrating. This also helps Hack Reactor staff check on a certain cohort's class list and repo page per student.
